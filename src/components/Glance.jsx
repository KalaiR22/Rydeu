            The Roman Empire has been an icon when it comes to historical
            importance. The Roman Empire had cut the ribbons when Augustus
            Caesar announced to be the first emperor of Rome in 31BC and ended
            with the fall of Constantinople in 1453CE. Known to be the centre of
            the Roman Empire, Rome attracts the majority of the crowd due to its
            rich history and politics.
